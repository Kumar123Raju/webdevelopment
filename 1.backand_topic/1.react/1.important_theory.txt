understand jsx:
   JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React, a popular JavaScript 
   library for building user interfaces. It allows you to write HTML-like code
   directly in your JavaScript files. JSX combines the power of JavaScript with
   the simplicity and expressiveness of HTML, making it easier to create dynamic
   and interactive web applications.
